 * Program
 *			Motorola S-Record Reader/Writer (SRecords)
 * Purpose
 *			This object provides a standardized way of reading or
 *          writing an S-Record text file. S-Records are one way
 *          of sharing binary data between applications. They are
 *          full text representations of the binary data.
 *
 *          From the MC68000 Family Programmer's Reference Manual:
 *
 *          An S-record format module may contain S-records of the following types:
 *
 *          S0 â€” The header record for each block of S-records. The code/data field
 *               may contain any descriptive information identifying the following
 *               block of S-records. The address field is normally zeros.
 *                  2 chars - "S0"
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte - number of data Hex pairs following this field
 *                                      (ie 2 for adr + 3 for data + 1 for checksum)
 *                  4 char Hex/2 byte Address Field (Big Endian)
 *                  6 char Hex/3 bytes - "HDR"
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte checksum
 *              Example: S00600004844521B
 *
 *          S1 - A record containing code/data and the 2-byte address at which the
 *               code/data is to reside.
 *                  2 chars - "S1"
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte - number of data Hex pairs in following this field
 *                  4 char Hex/2 byte Address Field  (Big Endian)
 *                  2n char Hex/ n bytes of Code/Data
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte checksum
 *              Example: S107003000144ED492
 *
 *          S2 - A record containing code/data and the 3-byte address at which the
 *               code/data is to reside.
 *                  2 chars - "S2"
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte - number of data Hex pairs in following this field
 *                  6 char Hex/3 byte Address Field  (Big Endian)
 *                  2n char Hex/ n bytes of Code/Data
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte checksum
 *
 *          S3 - A record containing code/data and the 4-byte address at which the
 *               code/data is to reside.
 *                  2 chars - "S3"
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte - number of data Hex pairs in following this field
 *                  8 char Hex/4 byte Address Field  (Big Endian)
 *                  2n char Hex/ n bytes of Code/Data
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte checksum
 *
 *          S5 - A record containing the number of S1, S2, and S3 records transmitted
 *               in a particular block. This count appears in the address field.
 *               There is no code/data field.
 *
 *          S7 - A termination record for a block of S3 records. The address field
 *               may optionally contain the 4-byte address of the instruction to which
 *               control is to be passed. There is no code/data field.
 *
 *          S8 - A termination record for a block of S2 records. The address field may
 *               optionally contain the 3-byte address of the instruction to which
 *               control is to be passed. There is no code/data field.
 *
 *          S9 - A termination record for a block of S1 records. The address field may
 *               optionally contain the 2-byte address of the instruction to which
 *               control is to be passed.  If this address is not specified, the first
 *               entry point specification encountered in the object module input will
 *               be used. There is no code/ data field.
 *                  2 chars - "S9"
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte - number of Hex pairs in following this field
 *                  4 char Hex/2 byte Address Field  (Big Endian)
 *                  2 char Hex/1 byte checksum
 *              Example: S9030000FC
 *
 *          Each block of S-Records uses only one termination record. S7 and S8 records
 *          are only active when control is to be passed to a 3- or 4- byte address;
 *          otherwise, an S9 is used for termination. Normally, there is only one S1
 *          header record, although it is possible for multiple header records to occur.
 *
 *          The checksum is the least significant byte of one's complement of the sum of
 *          the values represented by the pairs of characters making up the record length,
 *          address, and the code/data fields.
 *
 * Remarks
 *	1.      None
