cmnLib
===============

**cmnLib** is one approach to providing simple C objects for
various environments such as Mac, PIC32MX7xx, and iOS.

It is intended that each object be self documenting and consistent
in its usage from other objects within this library.

However, this is a work in progress, constantly evolving and some
objects/environments may be incomplete, duplicated, buggy or all
of those. lol

All of this library is committed to the Public Domain.  See 'obj.h'
for a list of the objects in the library.

My primary development environment is MacOSX with Xcode. The C code
is ANSI C and should be compilable with any ANSI C compiler. Use
'mkLib.sh' after adjusting it to create the library. If you are
using Xcode, you will find a test program for almost every object.
Some are tests are pretty complete, but all of them need more
complete testing.
