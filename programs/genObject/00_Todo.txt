*   Merge in genGetterSetter.
    *   JSON -  (???) properties:[[int,uint32_t,name],[ptr,int8_t,name],[object,ObjName,name]]
*   Change Gen to create an AStr instead of a file ???
*   Think about separating each method into its own AStr
    which would be stored by type (internal, class, property, 
    general). Add class to each (private, ???, public).
    Add read/write property to all properties which would
    indicate where to gen headers (ie .h or _internal.h)
    Have each have a description.  Generate files with
    methods/properties generated in alphabetical order
    within class.
        method name
        method type (private, property, public)
        method class (read, write, read_write) for public
                    If class is absent, gen read_write in 
                    _internal.h
*   Run output through a C Beautifier, look in old UtilCommand directory
