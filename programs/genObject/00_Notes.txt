The object of genObject is to be able to generate a basic object with certain attributes
such as inheritance, JSON support, etc.  It takes a basic JSON description of the object
and generates the necessary files which are required.  For instance, the "_json.c" file
is only needed if JSON support is requested. By generating these files, a lot of basic
work and errors can be avoided.

The program has the following classes for performing certain jobs:
    
    "Main" inherits from "Appl" and provides the command line interface to the program.
    "Dict" inherits from "NodeHash" and provides a Dictionary of Data needed.
    "NodeClass" contains the data and methods to define a class with its properties,
         "NodeProp".
    "NodeProp" contains the Class properties such as ???.
    "Gen" generates a file given "Dict" and ??? to use for substitution or ???.
