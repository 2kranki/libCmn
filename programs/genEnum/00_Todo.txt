*   Maybe use as input a csv file:
    name,value,description
    *   Description would be generated in the enum only.
    *   value would be optional and only used for non-contiguous enums.

*   Allow blank lines to bump value, but not generate entry.

*   If values are not contiguous, generate double index (??), first index
    is uint16_t to index + 1 into second array which contains name,value pairs
    (as we have now). 0 in first index would indicate no entry.
    cPrefixType would still be max allowed.
